What is haplo ?
===============

Haplo is finite element analysis software. Its main application domain
is mechanical and structural  analysis. Haplo user interface  is based
on specific  object-oriented-language  which  could be  used  for  any
framework.

The  package ``haplo''  is  just a  bundle of package ``haplo-kernel''
which is  the  base   of  Haplo and   plugins like  ``haplo-fem''   or
``haplo-xhaplo''. In the  future  it will  contain  more plugins.  The
plugins need ``haplo-kernel''  to be compiled  and used.  To get start
with all  these  sub-packages, have a  look   to subdirs  `kernel' and
`plugins/*'
